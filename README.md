# dotfiles
Dotfiles setup, shell scripts and whatnot

## Setup
1. I personally like this repo just start things off: https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup
2. After that, I'd recommend doing this: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
3. BASH is not my thing, so we're gonna use ZSH with OH-MY-ZSH: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
  `curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh`
4. For the theme, we're gonna use a theme made by my awesome mentor, [Brock Angelo](https://github.com/brock).
